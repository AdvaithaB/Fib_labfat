# Flask app based on the Fibonacci series

Using Flask (python 3), HTML, CSS and deployed with Heroku!

## How it works

The famous [Fibonacci Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) can be calculated with a recursive algorithm, with some sort of built-in memory (in an attempt of optimizing the time of calculation). With this, we can go as far as calculating the 99999th Fibonacci number. The code for the algorithm itself is pretty short, you can find it in [fib.py](https://github.com/PzanettiD/fibonacci-web/blob/master/fib.py).
